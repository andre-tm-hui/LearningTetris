# LearningTetris

4th Year Masters Project at Durham University

In this repo, we explore the Tetris-playing ability of several agents:
- A heuristic-based Genetic Algorithm player
- A heuristic-assisted Deep Q-Learning network
- A 'blind' Deep Q-Learning network

We find that the GA agent is able to perform the best, whilst there's minimal differences between the two Deep networks. However, none of the agents were capable of matching or exceeding human performance.
